## Gameplay Overview :video_camera:

Hello

## Project Information

### General

<p align="justify"> In this game, "Roboto", you enter the game as one of three different blobs trying to steal as much money as possible from the three story bank before the time runs out. Each blob possesses two different abilities altering the games base mechanics and overall jist to the game. There are various features such as time penalties which lower the players time, making it more crucial whilst playing, and enemies that fire lasers, also lowering the player's time making it feel more engaging and fun. 

### Objective

<p align="justify"> The main objective of this game is to steal as much money as possible within the given time frame whilst trying to lose as minimal time as possible. There are different variations of money ranging from a stack of cash worth $10,000 to a diamond worth $100,000 giving more choice to the game, allowing the player to decide what the most optimal path is. The three different classes can help the player decide which style they want to play which could aid them in making quicker moves and stealing more money. After your run, you have to escape through the van before the time runs out, giving the player incentive to plan ahead of there heist so they make it back on time. Different endings depend on the amount of money you have stolen, which makes the player want to beat the game by unlocking all the endings.

### Character Selection :ballot_box_with_check:

Character Selection
<!-- Image of character selection -->

<p align="justify"> By pressing the "Play" button in the main menu, the camera then moves down as if you are looking around the bullet board to the play section. In this section, the player then chooses between three characters each with it's own abilities changing the games mechanics. Each character chosen also changes the number of robots around the map, and the amount of damage they do, so each character isn't the exact same stuff but almost an entire new game mode the player can choose from. None of these characters are locked so the player is freely able to choose which ever character they feel like playing.

#### Character 1 : Ghost

![Ghost Showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeed9192-a8f8-4fbf-9a18-af71ce7670a8)
<!-- Demo of character Ghost -->

<p align="justify"> Ghost is the first character choice in this game as changes up the game quite a lot. Most notably, it's ability too phase through anything across the whole map. The game requires you too collect items such as keycards in order to access more doors / vaults / areas of the map, but when you pick "Ghost", you can freely move around the map. But this character does have it's drawbacks such as being able to be 'one shot' by any robot in the game and a reduced timer only being 3 minutes. From the video above, I haven't implemented the unique abilities from each character yet.
